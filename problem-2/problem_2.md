**Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:**
**1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...**
**By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.**
O,E,O,O,E,O,O,E,O,O,
A number in the Fibonacci sequence can only be even if its 2 preceding terms are either both even or both odd, as it turns out, every 3rd term is even.
As it also turns out, there isn't really a whole lot I can do with this information.
