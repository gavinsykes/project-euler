# Project Euler
My attempts at solving the Project Euler problems in a variety of languages.

When getting further into this challenge I decided it would be appropriate to solve each problem in a variety of languages, particularly:
 - PHP, so that my website will be able to poll the scripts via AJAX for interactivity, see https://www.gavinsykes.uk/project-euler.php
 - JavaScript, as that is the language required by the freeCodeCamp challenges
 - Python, to practice Python more than anything else and have a way to solve these in the terminal
 - I have also started doing these in C for faster processing
